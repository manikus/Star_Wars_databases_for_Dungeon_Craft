//         attack bonus=3<cr>

//  ************ Now for the interesting part  ***********
//
// Each spell is defined by the following fields:
//
// Name (text, required)
// Each spell must have a uniue name.  You may add a qualifier to a 
// name (separated with a vertical bar) to make it unique.  For example:
//    Dimwittify
//    Dimwittify|sorta
//    Dimwittify|really
//
// The qualifier is only used when editing a design.  The qualifier 
// is discarded when the binary files for the design are created.  But
// the unique name is necessary during the design stage to allow unambiguous
// references to the spells.  During gameplay they are identified by a
// binary integer 'key' so there is no confusion between the three Dimwittifies
// even though they are all printed as 'Dimwittify'.
//
/// default is all blanks which makes the entire spell a comment
// eg:     name = subliminal flash
//
// Cast Msg (text)
//   This is the text displayed when the spell is cast. You can substitute
//   the names of the target, caster, and spell by using /t, /c, and /s
//   default is none
//   eg: /c blasts /t with /s
//
// Casting sound (file name, or "none", or "Default")

// Combine multiple classes using the + sign
// Only MagicUsers can cast spells from the MagicUser school
// MagicUsers cannot cast spells from the cleric school

// The following example creates a spell that can only be cast by
// clerics and rangers. Also, 'Class = Cleric' should preceed this.

// Spell Effect

//    Script3 = optional, A GPDL script that is evaluated at runtime to determine how
//              the saving throw of the spell target is modified based on current game data

//    Scripts are optional and can be left blank. However, if Script3 is used and the others
